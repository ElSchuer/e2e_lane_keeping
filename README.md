# Model Scale End-to-End Lane Keeping

## Overview

In this project a end-to-end-solution for autonomous lane keeping is developed using imitation learning.
The goal is to develop a robust lane keeping system for a model scale car (scale 1:8) for indoor szenarios (e.g. driving szenarios of the Carolo Cup).

The solution is based on the NVIDIA End-to-End Autonomous Driving paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.07316.pdf) and the project of Muddassir Ahmed Khan (https://github.com/muddassir235/Self-Driving-Car-Steering-Simulator).
The udacity autonomous driving simulator (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) is used for prototyping and simulation of the method.
