# e2e_lane_keeping


In this project a end-to-end-solution for autonomous lane keeping is developed using imitation learning.
The goal is to develop a robust lane keeping system for a model scale car (scale 1:8) for indoor szenarios (e.g. driving szenarios of the Carolo Cup).

The solution is based on the NVIDIA End-to-End Autonomous Driving paper () and the project of .... ().
The udacity autonomous driving simulator () is used for prototyping and simulation of the method.
